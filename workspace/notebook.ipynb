From the total cleaned dataset of `13,926 customers`, `Email's` dominance likely stems from its efficiency and scalability, while the less frequent use of the combined approach may reflect its higher resource requirements, and the `Call` method's moderate usage suggests a balanced but less extensive implementation compared to `Email`.\n\n![1pro](1pro.png)\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3e54e4a3-b923-46a2-9a3a-bd45fa8f23e2"},{"source":"## What does the spread of the revenue look like overall? And for each method?\n\nBased on the analysis, the overall revenue spread reveals a `minimum` of `$32.54` and a `maximum` of `$238.32`, with a `mean` revenue of `$93.93` and a median around `$90.00`. The standard deviation falls within the range of approximately `$45 to $50`, indicating moderate variability across the dataset.\n\n![Q2P1](Q2P1.png)\n\n\n_`The analysis of the overall revenue distribution`_, as depicted in the histogram, reveals two prominent clusters. The first peak occurs around `$50`, primarily attributed to the Call method, while a second, larger peak is observed between `$90 and $100`, largely associated with the `Email` method. Additionally, smaller peaks are noted in the `$150 to $200` range, corresponding to the combined `Email + Call` approach. The distribution illustrates the complete range of revenue, spanning from `$32.54 to $238.32`, highlighting the varied revenue outcomes across different sales methods.\n\n\n![Q2p2](Q2p2.png)\n\n\n_`The box plot of revenue distribution by sales`_ method reveals distinct trends. The `Call` method shows a narrow revenue spread, mostly between `$40 and $50`, with minimal variability and a few outliers above `$70`. The Email method has a moderate spread between `$80 and $105`, with some variability and outliers up to `$150`. The `Email + Call` method has the widest spread, primarily between `$155 and $190`, with the highest variability and multiple outliers exceeding `$200`.\n\n\n\n![Q2p3](Q2p3.png)\n\n\n_`The density plot of revenue by sales`_ method highlights distinct patterns. The `Call` method displays sharp peaks around `$50`, with a concentrated distribution and limited spread. The `Email` method shows a main concentration around `$90-$100`, with a broader spread than `Call` and a single dominant peak. The `Email + Call` method features multiple peaks between `$150 and $200`, the widest spread, and the most dispersed distribution among all methods.\n\n_`Key insights`_ show that the `Email + Call` method generates the `highest` revenue but with the most variability and resource demands. The `Email` method offers a balanced revenue with moderate variability, while the `Call` method is the most consistent, though it yields the lowest revenue. Overall, the distribution reveals distinct patterns for each method, with `Email + Call` having the highest revenue but also the greatest variability.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"21609f1d-34fb-4d83-8359-4c8bc599df00"},{"source":"## **Was there any difference in revenue over time for each of the methods?**\nOver six weeks, the `Email` method showed stable performance with moderate revenue around `$90-100`, making it the most consistent.

This method has proven most efficient, requiring minimal team effort while consistently generating moderate revenue `($90-100 per sale)` and successfully reaching nearly half of our customer base `(49.7%).` While the Email + Call method produces higher revenue `($150-190),` its resource requirements and limited reach `(15.8% of customers)` make it better suited as a selective strategy for high-value opportunities, rather than a primary approach. The standalone Call method, despite reaching `34.5%` of customers, yields the lowest returns `($40-50)` while demanding the most time `(30 minutes per customer)`, making it the least efficient option. Therefore, adopting Email as the primary method, supplemented by targeted use of `Email + Call` for premium opportunities, offers the optimal balance of resource efficiency, revenue generation, and scalability for our sales strategy.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a48b9d2b-d162-4790-bdc2-98c833b17c1a"},{"source":"## **Business Metrics:**\nTo effectively evaluate and optimize our sales strategies, I monitor key metrics that assess both revenue and resource efficiency across different sales approaches.\n\n**_`Revenue per Customer Contact (RPC)`_** is a crucial metric that measures the efficiency of each sales method. For the Email method, RPC stands at `$95.23`, reflecting a moderate yet consistent return. The Call method generates `$46.78 per contact`, indicating a lower return, while the combined `Email + Call` approach yields the highest RPC at `$175.45`, though it is more resource-intensive.\n\n**_`Resource Efficiency Ratio (RER)`_** evaluates the revenue generated per hour of time spent on each method. The Email method proves to be the most efficient, with `$1,142.76 per hour`, given its quick `5-minute` engagement time. The Call method, with a higher time investment of `30 minutes` per customer, only generates `$93.56 per hour.` The `Email + Call` approach, though yielding good returns at `$701.80 per hour`, requires a combined time investment of `15 minutes per` customer.\n\n**_`Customer Response Rate (CRR)`_** indicates the percentage of customers who made a purchase. The Email method has the highest response rate at` 49.7%,` reaching nearly half of all customers. The Call method follows with a `34.5% `response rate, while the `Email + Call` method engages only `15.8%` of customers but offers the potential for high-value sales.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"290c8802-e526-4406-a597-bc9141e4a1cb"},{"source":"## **Recommendation**:\n\nBased on the metrics and cost-benefit analysis, My recommendation would be as follows:\n\n`Primary Recommendation:`\n\nUse Email as the main sales method because:\n\n1.
